## StealthDialer

A magic/mentalism app for performing a variety of "over the phone" effects. Was first released around 2013. 

Now open sourced. The Java/Android project is in the StealthDialer folder and a quick rundown, and a pre-rolled APK, are in the "misc" folder. With regards to the rundown, you should have a basic foundational grasp of concepts of magic and mentalism.
